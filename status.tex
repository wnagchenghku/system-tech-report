\section{Current Status of \xxx and \yyy} \label{sec:status}
We have studied the state-of-the-art consensus protocols and summarized 
three main issues of them on providing efficient fault tolerance to 
general server programs. Based on our analysis, we proposed \xxx, an RDMA-based 
\paxos system that can efficiently replicate unmodified server programs.
By integrating \xxx into VM, we proposed a novel Virtualized \smr 
system \yyy that makes VM fault-tolerance faster, more scalable, and 
more robust.

So far, we have come up with a complete system design of \xxx, including the 
normal case, leader election, and failure recovery protocol. We have 
implemented the normal case protocol of \xxx (\S\ref{sec:normal}) and collected 
initial evaluation results (\S\ref{sec:evaluation}). We will continue to 
implement other protocols (\ie, leader election and failure recovery) for 
handling failure scenarios and test its performance and robustness. Besides, we 
will finish the development of several optimization mechanisms like transparent 
replication. An academic paper on \xxx has already been published 
at ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing 2017 (SoCC 2017).

Until now, we have brought up with a complete system design of \yyy and 
proposed several optimizations for improving the 
performance (\S\ref{sec:vm-integration}). For implementation, we have integrated 
\xxx into \kvm QEMU and finished developing the normal synchronization protocol 
and collected initial evaluation results. We will continue to implement the 
failure handling protocol and meanwhile measure the performance of our 
optimization techniques. We have published an academic paper about a novel disk 
replication design of \yyy at 23th IEEE International Conference on Parallel 
and Distributed Systems (ICPADS 2017).

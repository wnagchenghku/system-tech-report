\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

\xxx is an RDMA-based \paxos system that can efficiently replicate general 
server programs. In this report, we have demonstrated the following properties 
of \xxx.

\textbf{Novel.} \xxx's runtime system provides transparent replication, uses 
fast RDMA primities to invoke consensus processes on requests concurrently 
(\S\ref{sec:concurrent}), handles atomic delivery of RDMA messages 
(\S\ref{sec:atomic}), etc. All these features make \xxx a novel RDMA-based 
\paxos system.

\textbf{Practical applicable.} Our initial results in Section 
(\S\ref{sec:evaluation}) show that \xxx can provide fault tolerance to server 
programs with low performance overhead without requiring server developers' 
intervention. Compared with \nprog server programs' unreplicated executions, 
\xxx incurred \latencyoverhead overhead in response time and \tputoverhead in 
throughput. Its consensus latency outperformed four traditional consensus 
protocols by at least \comptradlow and faster than a recent RDMA-based consensus 
protocol \dare by \fasterDARE in average. This consensus latency stayed almost 
constant  to the number of replicas and concurrent requests. Besides, Section 
(\S\ref{sec:vm-integration}) indicates that \xxx has the potential to greatly 
improve the reliability of other applications (\eg, virtual machine) as well.

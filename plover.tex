\section{Integrating \xxx into virtual machine} \label{sec:vm-integration}
Virtual machines usually use a primary-backup architecture for fault 
tolerance~\cite{alsberg1976principle}. However, primary-backup approach is 
notorious for the ``split-brain'' problem~\cite{scales2010design}, which can be 
avoided in \paxos. One reason for fault tolerant VMs to use 
primary-backup replication instead of \paxos protocol is that traditional 
\paxos 
systems incur high performance overhead. Specifically, every 
request received by the virtual machine must go through the traditional \paxos 
systems to reach consensus first, which takes hundreds of microseconds, and 
then 
be processed by the server programs. This high consensus latency severely 
degrades the performance of the applications running inside.

By integrating the fast \xxx \paxos protocol into virtual machine, we 
efficiently mitigate the ``split-brain'' problem caused by the primary-backup 
approach. We implemented the prototype on KVM QEMU hypervisor and it took fewer 
than ten lines of code by leveraging the simple API provided by \xxx.

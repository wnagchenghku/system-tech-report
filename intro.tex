\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Existing \paxos protocols suffer from high, scale-limited consensus latency. OS 
kernel, a major source of this problem, can be bypassed with advanced network 
features such as Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) within the same datacenter.

In this report, we present \xxx, an RDMA-based \paxos protocol and its runtime 
system that can efficiently provide fault tolerance to unmodified server 
programs. \xxx intercepts an unmodified server program's inbound socket calls 
(\eg, \recv), assigns a total order for all received requests in all 
connections, and uses fast RDMA primitives to invoke consensus on these requests 
concurrently. To ensure the same robustness as regular \paxos, \xxx's runtime 
system efficiently tackles several reliability challenges such as atomic 
delivery of messages (\S\ref{sec:atomic}).
